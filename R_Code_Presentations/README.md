This folder is intended to share R code of selected presentations. Each presenter should:

1. Fork the repository
2. Add a folder into the current folder [R_Code_Presentations](https://github.com/isglobal-exposomeHub/ExposomeDataChallenge2021/tree/main/R_Code_Presentations) with his/her name
3. Put all the R code, .Rmd files, vignettes or whatever other file it is required to reproduce the presented results into that new folder
4. Make a pull request
